	<p>Hello Readers,</p>
	<p>I'm Axay Saradva, Electronics and Communication Engineering Student at LD College of Engineering</p>
	<p>I'm currently studing communication and writing what i have learned and teaching it to others help us understand subject in deeper way and give you new perspectives in subject.So i have decided to write about what i have learned, that will help me keep track of how much i have learned and what i need to focus on.</p>
	<p> Topics I'll write about are mostly Wireless Communication topics like GSM, 3G, 4G, Wifi, blutooth, and other cellular system concepts.
	
	I'll also write on Embedded topics like Digital Logic, Basic Electronics, Serial interfaces, Microcontroller and other topics. </p>
	
	<p> I'll try to add some styling in future, when i'll have some extra time.
	Thank you.</p>
